    "\n",
    "1. **Выбор модели.**  \n",
    "   Для продакшена целесообразно использовать именно нашу **обученную RNN-модель**:\n",
    "   - она заметно лучше справляется с бытовым стилем текстов, чем «сырой» distilgpt2;\n",
    "   - по метрикам ROUGE-L показывает устойчивое превосходство на всех длинах контекста;\n",
    "   - архитектура проще и компактнее, быстрее обучается и дешевле в инференсе, что важно для внедрения в реальные продукты с ограниченными ресурсами.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Качество генерации.**  \n",
    "   Сейчас используется жадный (greedy) поиск. Это приводит к:\n",
    "   - корректным, но порой слишком коротким завершениям;\n",
    "   - ограниченному разнообразию ответов.  \n",
